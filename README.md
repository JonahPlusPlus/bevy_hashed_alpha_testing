# bevy_hashed_alpha_testing

A basic benchmark for hashed alpha rendering

Assumes you have bevy with the hashed branch in the same directory.

Move around using Mouse and WASD.

This isn't anything fancy, just changed the `AlphaMode`  to whatever mode you want to try and then look at the avg FPS in the terminal.

There can be a 10% to 15% performance boost using hashed alphas over blend alphas.

My basic machine specs:
* CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 2600
* RAM: 16GB DDR4
* GPU: Radeon RX 580 with dedicated 8GB VRAM
